#example-simple

This iOS project represents a very simple implementation of the Smartwhere Proximity SDK.

**The AppDelegate.m didFinishLoadingWithOptions method must be modified to reflect the target account values for the application id, api key and secret values.  These values are available on the web administrator under section Admin -> Account Information _You must be an account administrator to view these values_**

This project uses a cocoapods podfile, so you will need to open the workspace instead of the procject.
If you prefer to install the Smartwhere.Framework directly, it is available on https://github.com/smartwhere/ios-sdk
